# Senior-Design-Aviation-App
### Senior design app created using SwiftUI

## Description:

### This app was created with pilots in mind. When pilots travel to unfamiliar airports, they often don't know where to eat. The Flying For Food app allows a pilot to select which airport they flew into and gives them restaurant options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Once an option is selected, Apple Maps will open and give the user directions to the restaurant.

## Data:

### The data was a Microsoft Excel sheet made by the course sponsors, which was formatted and placed through a JavaScript program to automatically upload the data to the database, Google's Firestore database.
